# Why, but Why this blog?

As we dig deeper into technical professional world, we explore and learn about a plethora of different technologies, architectures, processes, success stories, use cases, company cultures AND people. Some of these are common to all while some are **unique** in their own way.

The best way to share such experiences with our fellow techies is to pour all of it into **_blogs_** which will be easier to follow and will enlighten on a variety of aspects of our teachnical community for newbies as well as experts.

With the intention of **_giving back to the community_**, we have created this blogging website to let anyone easily **contribute** with any of their **rich learning contents** with the people. 

Moreover, to make sure that more time is being invested in _creating the content_ of the blog and _not editing it_, we have kept everyone's favourite file format for all blogs, right its `.md` . So gear upp & feel free to follow our guide to be able to have your findings be available for our tech fam as an informtive blog !!
