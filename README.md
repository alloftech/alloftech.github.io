Blogging has been one of the truest ways of demonstrating technical ideas, architectures, tools, technologies and lots more. There is a pile of blogging websites which offer different features based on the  subscription we pay for. It becomes overwhelming to choose between soo many alternatives and yet to have something customized as per our needs.

[AllOfTech](https://alloftech.github.io) was created to overcome the hassles of finding a blogging website with a subscription to dump our ideas & experiences for others to refer & use. 

As of now, blog posting and feedback on blogs as comments is the feature enabled on the website. Moving ahead, we have planned to incorporte many other required features like categorizing, searching and many more.

For a blog to be posted on the website, one should simply :
- Fork the repository
- Create a `.md` file in `/_posts/` folder refering the format mentioned in contribution guide
- Keep ll the images and gifs if any related to the post in /assets/images/ folder refering the format mentioned in contribution guide
- Raise a PR to be merged in this repository
