Blogging has been one of the truest ways of demonstrating technical ideas, architectures, tools, technologies and lots more. There is a pile of blogging websites which offer different features based on the  subscription we pay for. It becomes overwhelming to choose between soo many alternatives and yet cannot have something customized as per our needs.

[AllOfTech](https://alloftech.github.io) was created to overcome the hassles of finding a suitable blogging website without any subscription to dump our ideas & experiences for others in the community to refer & use. 

As of now, blog posting and feedback on blogs as comments are the feature enabled on the website. Moving ahead, we have planned to incorporte many other required features like categorizing, searching and many more.

For a blog to be posted on the website, one should simply :
- Fork the repository
- Create a **markdown** file in [`/_posts/`](/_posts/) folder refering the format mentioned in [contribution](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide
- Keep all the _images_ and _gifs_, if any, related to the post in [`/assets/images/`](/assets/images/) folder refering the format mentioned in contribution guide
- **Raise a PR** to be merged in this repository

Suggestions and feedbacks are always welcome !!
