With support of huge number of libraries which enables provision for easy compatibility for any tool, **_Python_** has been one of the most used programming language for scripting. In this blog, we will look at how can we can easily increase the efficiency of our scripts multifold based on our usecase.

### <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Default Python Execution </span>

Lets first understand how python program is executed.

|:--:|
| *CPython Implementation* |

- First you write your python code in file, lets call that file _foo.py_.
 - You execute your code using below command <br>
   `python foo.py`

 - Ofcourse, computer doesn't understand this high level language as computer works only on machine language. To convert your code to machine language, python performs following steps:
    - Python code gets compiled to **bytecode** and gives `.pyc` file, in our case _foo.pyc_
    - This `.pyc` file then gets **interpreted** to machine language in **PVM**(_Python Virtual Machine_) and finally you get your output
 - This process of implementation is referred as **CPython**.
 - **Python is a programming language & CPython is default implementation of python.**

<br><br>

 ### <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Default Python (CPython) VS PyPy </span>

 ## CPython:

 - CPython is the default byte-code interpreter of Python, which is written in **C** programming language.
 - When you install python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/), default interpreter is **CPython**.
 - **CPython basically converts your code to bytecode first and then interprets this bytecode to machine language and gives you desired output.**
 - CPython tends to be slower due to multilevel conversion of your code.

<br>


 ## PyPy:

 - As we now understand the reason for CPython to be slow, to fill this gap, **PyPy** is used.
 - PyPy is written in **RPython**(_Restricted Python - a subset of python_)
 - But what makes PyPy faster ? It is **JIT Compiler**.
 - **PyPy uses JIT or Just-in-Time compilation approach to compile the source code directly into native machine code instead of bytecode. Thereby making the code to run faster by skipping any intermediate conversion.**
 - PyPy is a compiler while CPython is an interpreter.
 - PyPy works faster for only **pure python code** i.e. there shouldn't be any embedded C code. If that's the case, it's performance deteriorates. 
 - So the use case where PyPy works best is when executing long-running programs where a significant fraction of the time is spent executing Python code.

 - Features of PyPy:
   - Significant increase in execution speed (4.4 times faster than CPython on an average.)
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Stackless

 - Drawbacks of PyPy:
   - if your code doesn't run for at least a few seconds, then the JIT compiler won't have enough time to warm up.
   - If all the time is spent in run-time libraries (i.e. in C functions), and not actually running Python code, the JIT compiler will not be any better than usual execution.
   - Not suitable for data science libraries as those contain C functions and not pure python code.

### <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Installion and setting up of PyPy3: </span>

Let's walk through installation of PyPy3 on different machines.
<br>

- Ubuntu:

  - Adding pypy to repository<br>
    `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pypy/ppa`

  - Updating packages<br>
    `sudo apt update`

  - Installing pypy3<br>
    `sudo apt install pypy3`

- Mac:

  - Installing pypy3 using _brew_ <br> 
    `brew install pypy3`

- Windows:

  - Download Windows Binary file from [official website](https://www.pypy.org/download.html)
  - Execute the binary for installation

<br>
## Installation of Pip:

 - Download the latest version of get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/.
 - go to the folder where you download get-pip and run following cmd:
   > pypy get-pip.py

## Running python code using pypy:

 - First write your python code.
 - then run following command instead of running > python3 <file_name.py>
   > pypy3 <file_name.py>

## Comparison between CPython and PyPy

 |![CPython](/assets/images/2022-10-08-00-python3-time-taken.png) |
 |:--:|
 | *time taken by CPython* |


 |![PyPy](/assets/images/2022-10-08-00-pypy3-time-taken.png) |
 |:--:|
 | *time taken by PyPy* |


As we can see by above example, PyPy took only 5 seconds to complete and CPython took 2 minutes and 20 seconds to complete.
So use PyPy for pure python code and use CPython if you have libraries which are in C and python language.
